The large format of the magazine, measuring approximately 21" x 15", and the fragile newsprint on which it was printed means that very few original copies have survived the passage of time. The magazine did, however, feature top-tier illustrations and cover art by notable artists such as Howard Chandler Christy, James Montgomery Flagg, Nell Brinkley, A. K. Macdonald, C. D. Mitchell, Léon Bakst, Erté, and Norman Rockwell, among others. A substantial portion of the interior art was the work of Lee Conrey, who was likely a significant influence on both Virgil Finlay and Alex Raymond. The magazine also featured occasional work by other artists such as John R. Flanagan, Orson Lowell, and Otto Soglow. The advertisements within the magazine were often spectacular and visually stunning, attracting the interest of many readers.' + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10) + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10) + N'In 1963, the name of the magazine was changed to *Pictorial Living*, before it was ultimately discontinued in 1966. The poor quality of the paper on which it was printed has resulted in many issues being lost, despite the magazine''s substantial circulation. This has led to it becoming a sought-after collector''s item for enthusiasts in the present day.{{Categories Magazines}}', N'Article created.', '7240be61-df81-46f9-8152-6a48b96abc40');
